# Shippable - Headstart

Based on "Build and Push Docker image to Docker Hub" at http://docs.shippable.com/ci/tutorial/build-push-image-to-docker-hub/

## 100 - Introduction

This tutorial explains how to continuously build and push a Docker image to Docker Hub.

We will start with a simple Node.js application, run some CI tests and code coverage, and then package the application into a Docker image and push it to Docker Hub.

This document assumes you're familiar with the following concepts:

[Docker build](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/)
[Docker push](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/push/)
[Docker login](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/login/)
[Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/)

If you're unfamiliar with Docker, you should start with learning how to implement this scenario manually. Refer to our blog for a step-by-step tutorial: [Build and push a Docker image to Docker Hub](http://blog.shippable.com/build-a-docker-image-and-push-it-to-docker-hub).
